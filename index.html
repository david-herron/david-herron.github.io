<h1>My Journey of Learning the Uke</h1>

<p>
I've always wanted to learn the ukulele. Recently, I was
visiting my friend, Jennie Tulenchik. She is an AWESOME musician, and she
plays the instrument, so I <i>very politely</i> asked her if I could borrow one of her ukes since she has a couple, and she said yes!
</p>

<p>
We spent an evening together. She played me some of her music, and explained some things to me. I thought the ukulele was a simple instrument, but I soon realized it is as complicated as any. For instance, there are four major types of ukes:
	<dl>
		<dt>SOPRANO</dt>
			<dd><i>&nbsp;This is the smallest of them, and it makes the sound most commonly associated with a uke.</i></dd>
		<dt>CONCERT</dt>
			<dd><i>&nbsp;Just slightly bigger than the soprano, so it has a slightly 		bigger sound.</i></dd>
		<dt>TENOR</dt>
			<dd><i>&nbsp;A bit bigger...</i></dd>
		<dt>BARITONE</dt>
			<dd><i>&nbsp;The grand daddy. The biggest of them all. These are tuned differently.</i></dd>
	</dl>
</p>

<p>
That's the major difference between them all. They just get bigger. I was given a soprano style. After some research, I found it to be the most common. That was helpful as I learned, because most of the online instructional materials were using this type of ukulele.
</p> 

<p>
So on we go! I'm going to show you what I've learned!
