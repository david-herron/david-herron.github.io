<p>
This might be the most important part of learning what it takes to be a decent player. You can know all the chords in the world, but if you can't strum/have no rhythm, they sound like garbage!
</p>

<p>
Basically, strumming consists of upstrokes and downstrokes. It's actually kind of amazing how different they sound from each other. Aside from those two techniques, there is the picking of the individual strings, but that is beyond this journal (:

<p>
Getting the right rhythm is really hard, and is what I probably spent the most time on..sorry neighbors!
