<h1>The Song</h1>
<h3>Let It Be</h3>
<h4><i>By The Beatles</i></h4>
</br>

<p>
Here is a link to the actual song:

<p>
With these chords in my arsenal, I decided to play this great song by The Beatles.</br>
Singing is out of my scope for now. Sorry!

So that is it really! I know it seems quick, but it really is a lot of work. I am going to work on my singing next. Hopefully I can learn a couple songs in time for campfire season!

I had a lot of fun doing this. I think everyone should take the time to learn an instrument. The ukulele is a pretty non-threatening instrument, so I think it is a great choice! I have heard the piano is great too, but I will leave that until later!
