<p>Rail was the dominant form of transportation. and was developing rapidly. It had definite advantages over previous forms of transportation such as the horse and carriage. They could carry more passengers, and it moved fast. It took 6 weeks to get from New York to Los Angeles. Previously, it would have taken twice as long!</p>

<p>Standard time zones are introduced in 1883 which allowed the railroads to operate more effectively and reduce accidents. It is not widely accepted by the public however.</p>
